I learned:
1) Christopher Colombus' had no idea what he was doing. He thought the world was smaller than scientists had calculated 
	and believed he could sail to India. If America did not exist he would have died.
2) I learned how the Git repository works and am excited to use it in the coming labs.
3) I learned how to prove truth statements using the axioms of logic.
